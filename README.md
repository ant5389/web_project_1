# web_project_1

This web page was created to show different learning techniques with some examples and resources for those that are struggling to find their own way. The page utilizes embedded videos as a learning tool from experts in the field and provides an excellent book reccomendation on the topic of learning.

The page demonstrates animations, hover effects, grid layouts, and lists to organize and emphasize certain aspects. Background color changes are used as block dividers to separate sections of content and maintain a single, scrolling web page.


### Future Plans
1. Add correct url's to links so user can navigate to intended pages
2. Change fonts to be more visually appealing to users
3. Add subtle and non-distracting animations to other images
